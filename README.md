## Project Overview

This repository contains an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** project on Spotify track metadata and audio features.  
The goal is to understand **distributions, relationships, and trends** in musical attributes (e.g., *energy, danceability, loudness*), identify top tracks and artists, explore **duration and popularity**, and analyze **temporal patterns** such as release years.

The analysis uses:
- Descriptive statistics  
- Visualizations  
- Regression plots  

…to surface insights for **music analytics** and **recommendation ideas**.
